### Purpose:
Monitor Ian Balina's ICO [spreadsheet](https://www.ianbalina.com/spreadsheet), extract data from the spreadsheet along with finding the respective link to the [ICODrops page](https://icodrops.com) if it exists. The data is then aggregated and posted into a personal Google Sheets file, and the link is sent to me via a Slack alert.
